# Java

I had to author extensive unit and integration tests to guarantee all significant features and possible edge cases are addressed to guarantee functionality. The best approaches to security include patching known vulnerabilities by updating libraries on a regular basis, validating all user input, and avoiding SQL injection with parameterized queries.

I understand user needs by carrying out thorough user research to identify their problems and goals using surveys, interviews, and usability testing.  Having this knowledge, you can translate those needs into clear features and design guidelines such that each feature fulfills an established user pain point exactly.

In order to satisfy project requirements, I start my software design process by creating an architect-level description that includes principal components and how they are interrelated. Then I proceed towards more detailed design, describing data structures, algorithms, and interfaces of every component in order to make the system effective and maintainable.
